# ACM-W RecruitmentTask - ML
The task gievn was to solve the iris dataset using logistic regression and KNN methods. 
The iris dataset is a dataset containing sepal lengths, sepal widths, petal lengths and petal widths of 150 different iris flowers. Of these 150 flowers, 50 are of the species virginica, 50 of species versicolor and 50 of species setosa. 
I started by analysing the data, verifying that there are no missing values and then creating scatterplots to visualise the data better. The plots show that virginica and versicolor species are similar and setosa species is the most different from both of them. 
I then split the dataset into a training set (used to train the model) and a test set (used to test the model on). The model is meant to study the data in the training set and using that, predict the species of the flowers in the test set. 
After printing the score of the model, I plotted heatmaps to show clearly where the model went wrong. I tested the model on different sizes of training sets as well.
I followed the above procedure for both Logistic Regression method and KNN method. I did not repeat the data visualisation for KNN as it had already been covered during Logistic Regression.
